# Some Useful Settings
These settings are optional and don't have anything to do with the addon, I
just find them helpful:

- `Keymap` > `Preferences` > `Pie Menu on Drag`
  - Holding `tab` and dragging now lets you instantly access all modes.
  - Pressing `z` quickly toggles between wire and normal, while holding
    it shows the usual pie.
- `Keymap` > `Preferences` > `Extra Shading Pie Menu Items`
  - `z` now lets you quickly toggle overlays (this used to be a feature
    in the addon before I discovered this setting!)
- Set `System` > `Memory & Limits` > `Undo Steps` to its max
  - it doesn't really slow anything down and is a lifesaver when you 
    realize you need to go 255 steps back.
- Set `Save & Load` > `Blend Files` > `Save Versions` to zero
  - Disables `.blend1` files which I always find useless because it's just
    a version of my file but missing the last 30 seconds of changes. If you
    want to keep some version around, copy it manually!
- Mapping `ctrl+space` to open the search menu (instead of f3, which is
  particularly cumbersome on my keyboard)
- If working with python scripts: 
  - enable `interface` > `display` > `developer extras`
  - enable `interface` > `display` > `python tooltips`
